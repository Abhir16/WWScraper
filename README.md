# WWScraper
Waterloo Works Scrapper using python requests.
I have just started this project, login and authentication is working, and navigating different tabs in system is functional.
Retreiving active apps needs to be done, and a master control file to gather and output data still have to be developed. 
The goal is to have a serverside service to retreive user's Waterloo Works information.
